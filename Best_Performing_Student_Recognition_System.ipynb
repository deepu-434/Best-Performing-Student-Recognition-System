        "\n",
        "> Design and Develop a Best-Performing Student Recognition System for a college to identify and appreciate the top 3 students from each admitted batch. The system should consider various factors, including but not limited to academic performance, consistency over semesters, excellence in core engineering courses, participation in local and national-level hackathons, paper presentations, and contributions such as assisting course teachers. The platform must feature a user-friendly interface and a well-structured database to manage student records, achievements, and rankings. Additionally, it should implement machine learning techniques to weigh these factors dynamically and rank students based on their overall contributions and performance. The system will aim to provide fair and data-driven results to recognize the best-performing students each year. The challenge lies in ensuring transparency, accuracy, and scalability as the number of students and criteria grows over time.\n",
